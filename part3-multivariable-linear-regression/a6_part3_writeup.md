# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The R Squared coefficient is 0.86, meaning the general relationship between the model and data should be strong.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
The model is very accurate because of the high correlation between the data and the model.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
10 year old car: $9,300, 20 year old car: $2,200

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
For cars that are very old it could mess with the model and instead of stopping at zero, it goes into the negatives.
