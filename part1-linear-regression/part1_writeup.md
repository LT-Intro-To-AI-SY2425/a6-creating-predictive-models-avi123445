# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.6258. This essentially shows that the linear regression model is moderately strong since the correlation is decently high.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137.5

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
The models predictions are moderately accurate and could maybe get a rough estimate of someone's blood pressure based on their age. Some ways to improve this model is to potentially add additional information that will better predict someone's blood pressure.
