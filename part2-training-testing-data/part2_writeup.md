# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model is more effective because it uses random statistics every time and also makes the data more generalizable and thus more effective.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R squared coefficient tells us how much of the change in someone's blood pressure can be explained by someone's age.The higher the value, the stronger the correlation.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

I would say my model is relatively accurate because the correlation coefficient is decently high, at least compared to the previous model.
